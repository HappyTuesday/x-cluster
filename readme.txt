This is the shell/ruby scripts project to create and initialize a linux cluster environment for x-road project.

It will start the following linux nodes:
1. dns 		-- the domain name service for all other linux nodes. With this node's work, we can use machine name to ssh one other machine.
2. master	-- the master node used for developing, checking code and controlling the deploying progress for x-road project.
